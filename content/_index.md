## 🎞️ Film 
I think film is very effective and versatile both as a visual and narrative medium. From age 12, I became interested in post-production and kinetic typography, teaching myself the fundamentals of Adobe Flash, Premiere and After Effects. Media art classes at Cornell helped me understand the nuances of cinematic elements such as lighting, sound, and shot sequencing, deepening my appreciation for the intricate efforts that goes into the earlier stages of the production pipeline.

## 🎨 Art & Design 
Two goals fueled my passion for art and design: 1) To banish Comic Sans from places where its appearance is most incongruous, and 2) to draw the anime protagonists whose brilliant complexions and heroic demeanors lingered in my dreams.

Now, as a creative hobbyist eager to refine my skills, I seek to deepen my understanding of perspective, color, and anatomy to enhance my graphic and character designs.
