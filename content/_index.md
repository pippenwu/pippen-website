🖥️ Software Engineering
-----------------------

Sleepless nights untangling bug-infested spaghetti code notwithstanding, venturing into the vast landscape of Computer Science has thus far been a rewarding journey. I deeply value the capacity software engineers possess to turn ideas and concepts into tangible realities. The thrill of crafting something innovative never ceases to excite me.

My ever-expanding Steam library is a testament to my gaming hobby, and I’ve unapologetically spent way too many hours hunting achievements. I'm a sucker for compelling storytelling, interesting mechanics, and captivating artwork. I relish the opporunity to work on projects that meld my Computer Science expertise with this love for gaming.

🎞️ Film & Post-Production
-------------------------

{{< figure src="house.jpg" alt="artsy instagram photo in front of japanese style dwelling">}}

I think film is very effective and versatile both as a visual and narrative medium. From age 12, I became interested in post-production and kinetic typography, teaching myself the fundamentals of Adobe Flash, Premiere, and After Effects. Media art classes I took at Cornell helped me understand the nuances of cinematic elements such as lighting, sound, and shot sequencing, deepening my appreciation for the intricate efforts that goes into the earlier stages of the production pipeline.

🎨 Art & Design
---------------

Two goals fueled my passion for art and design: 1) To banish Comic Sans from places where its appearance is most incongruous, and 2) to draw the anime protagonists whose brilliant complexions and heroic demeanors lingered in my dreams.

Now, as a creative hobbyist eager to refine my skills, I seek to deepen my understanding of perspective, color, and anatomy to enhance my graphic and character designs.

💪🏼 Physical Exertion

On ocassion I compel myself to emerge from the secluded but comfortable walls of my room into the mysterious beyond. I enjoy jogging, hiking, and swimming. I have also tried my hand at gymnastics and pole dancing.
