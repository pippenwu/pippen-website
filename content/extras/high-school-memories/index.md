The **Intelligent Ironman Creativity Contest** had been a recurring event every year of high school and every year we got to be one of 24 teams (out of close to two thousand) to enter the finals. The contest lasts for 72 hours straight and each team strives to create something interesting that adhered to the specific instructions of that year. The first year we made a museum[^1], the second a play[^2](and we won the champion[^3]!), and the third an interactive exhibition[^4].

It's a contest filled with fun[^5], performances[^6], and prize money[^7] :)
