**City of Light** is a top-down, puzzle-based stealth game where Annette, a mime performer in the era of Art Nouveau, has to use her mime powers to evade hostile mythical creatures and safely reach the level exit. 

I am the software lead of Fire Works, a team of six students (Amanda Trang, Catherine Sadoff, Emma Cohn, Olivia Xiang, Yangying Ji, and myself) in CS3152 (Introduction to Computer Game Architecture). The game utilizes the libGDX game development framework and Box2D Physics Engine, and I worked heavily on code architecture and game AI. I also designed filmstrips for some animations in the game, as well as our studio logo, the game manual, the showcase poster, and the promotional videos. City of Light won one of the audience favorite awards at [GDIAC showcase](https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/gdiac/), and is accepted into [BostonFIG](https://www.bostonfig.com/fest-homepage/) 2018.

The game (for [mac](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12StW34rVRCWCiVgxGchtRuTm_3kdiWM2/view), and for [windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wq8YzTxDVcejGkISxtfcTEiwjALAmlCA/view)) and [game manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdIreeRSUncBHh4fuYKexzef8E0Zlxwn/view) are available for download. Here is our [github repository](https://github.com/Oliviafx/cs3152-game).
