**Literary Maps of Tainan （府城文學地圖）** is a book published in 2014 that, in over four hundred pages, follows the footsteps of eleven Taiwanese authors and correlates references in their writings with locations in the city. The book started out as a side project of my high school class, and has since gone through two editions and received significant press coverage. As a joint author and designer of the first edition, I worked with Yuan-Liou Publishing Company to design and promote the second version of the book.

Literary Maps of Tainan is available for purchase [here](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010672594).
