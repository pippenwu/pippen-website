**The Era of Legends** is a role-playing campaign featuring a branching narrative that follows the tales of four protagonists. Excused from English classes, I worked on this independent project for three years throughout high school and it culminated in a 140-page blend of story and gameplay. 

While some encouraged me to publish it as a book, the significant polish it still required both in proofreading the text and testing the mechanics, combined with the imminency of graduation led me to fall back on my original plan: print a few copies and present them to select teachers as a farewell gift. Although I haven't revisited it since graduation, I enjoyed crafting the storylines, designing the mechanics, and creating the art.
