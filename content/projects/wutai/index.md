Funded by the Youth Development Administration, four of my high school friends and I went deep into the mountains of Vedai to experience and understand the cultures and traditions of the Rukai people, an aboriginal Taiwanese tribe. Here is [a journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-RjkK2KNFOYdkJUMW4tTzlDR2M/view?resourcekey=0-BckylO7xju1tiX_q0W_CTQ) documenting what we've seen and learned, and we also made two original songs while we were there.
