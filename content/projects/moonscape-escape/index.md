**Escape the Moonscape** is an experimental virtual tour offering an immersive exploration of the distinctive moon-like landscapes nestled in southern Taiwan. The tour combines aerial footage with interactive storytelling and game elements. This is the main project that I worked on during my 2019 summer internship at Taiwan AI Labs.

The project utilizes various image processing and machine learning algorithms, such as sky replacement, style transfer, and object detection. I [flew a drone](https://pepper-mint.medium.com/%E6%88%91%E5%BE%88%E6%A3%92-%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E9%A3%9B%E7%84%A1%E4%BA%BA%E6%A9%9F%E5%B0%B1%E5%A2%9C%E6%A9%9F-e6899606915c) to collect aerial footage, wrote the script for the story, created art assets of story characters, and prototyped the virtual tour using Python, PHP, and Javascript. 

I wrote [this](https://pepper-mint.medium.com/%E6%88%91%E7%95%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E5%B8%AB-%E6%88%91%E5%9C%A8%E5%AF%AB%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B-5da0e19c0427) and [this](https://pepper-mint.medium.com/%E6%88%91%E7%95%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E5%B8%AB-%E6%88%91%E5%9C%A8%E5%AF%AB%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B-2-a7ee79abf85) article documenting the work that I did, my thought processes, and my internship experience overall.
